        "\n",
        "One more important point to be noted is that after certain $n$ steps we will find that $\\gamma$ values are increasing and that represents the decay. Since the $\\gamma$ values are less than zero so the incresing the powers will result in the much lesser values.\n",
        "\n",
        "So intuitively speaking the if you are the current timestep $t$ and the previous person's information can be of less important as compared to the current person's information thus we are using the concept of decay to make the previous person's infor. less important.\n",
